External speakers (or Guitar Amplifier)


## Setup and Operation

Note: Be sure to set up the laser harp under the lighting conditions where it will be played to ensure that the sensors accurately detect a beam break activity. 

1. Open the laser harp box to expose the contents.

2. Inset two metal posts into the post holders, and tighten the screws (hand tight).

3. Remove the laser crossbar

4. Place the cross bar into the posts

5. Connect the laser diodesâ€™ power supply so that the lasers turn on

6. Adjust the photo-resistor positions such that the lasers are aligned (i.e., the laser beam overlaps the photo-resistor).

7. Connect the Arduino to the speaker.

8. Turn on the speaker.

9. Connect Arduino to power supply.

10. The Arduino will go through an auto-threshold adjustment code to determine the right threshold to trigger. 
This should take 10-15 seconds, and will play a chord when it is ready.

11. Replace cover pieces onto harp box.

12. Play. If external lighting changes, reset the Arduino.
